                I'm a Junior Product Designer with a background in software development â€” which means I understand both sides of the handoff. With 1.5+ years of experience in startups and corporate teams, I design experiences that are not only intuitive for users but also seamless for developers to bring to life.
              </p>
              
              <p className="text-text-secondary leading-relaxed">
                Grounded in economics, I bring an optimization mindset to product design, always seeking to reduce friction, align goals, and streamline the journey. By blending behavioral psychology with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, Google's Material Design, and emerging patterns in intelligent interfaces, I create the kind of digital experiences that just click.
